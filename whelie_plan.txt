* generate demand
	base demand: proportional to existing users
	spot demand: new customers coming
	
* check available cars
	if we can't satisfy demand - rent proportionally to existing and new clients
	calculate rentals based on satisfiable demand
	
* create new customers - as many as stems from proportional demand
	create addresses, cities and countries.
		in config - we specify how many clients come from PL vs abroad
	customer age should follow gaussian dist. with cutoff at 18 and 70
	
* generate rentals
	* durations should be 2-10 days, rentals on weekends should mostly end on Sunday (make this configurable)
	* configurable periodicity (one or more configurations - additive)
		* amplitude in %
		* period in days
	* required start date for periodicity calculation (so it's not hidden in the code)
